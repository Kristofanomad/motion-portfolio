# Motion Portfolio - Project Status & TODO

## Current Status
-   **Video Registry**: Built and populated (`src/data/motion-assets.ts`).
-   **Premium UI**: Implemented glassmorphism, rounded corners, and focus/dimming effects.
-   **Dev Server**: Running on **port 3001** (http://localhost:3001).
-   **Landing Page Plan**: Approved but partially executed (code files updated, pending full verification).

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)

### Step 1: Implement Full-Screen Hero
-   Verify `page.tsx` renders the first video as a full-screen background.
-   Ensure the "Scroll to Explore" indicator works.

### Step 2: Apply Reveal Animation
-   Verify `ReelItem.tsx` title slide-up animation works on hover.
-   Confirm monospace typography is applied.

### Step 3: Verify Mobile Responsiveness
-   Check layout on mobile viewports.
-   Ensure `h-screen` (or `h-[100dvh]`) behaves correctly for the hero section.
